This assignment was closely related to the last group assignment. So I thought I would make the same dynamic javascript, by having emty elements in my html file. I started making the boilertemplate for the html file. I started using the terminal to create the folders and the files, then commited them. The first thing I created in the html fil was the header and, div for the questions. Then inputed the variables I wanted for the styling, and ofcourse set the inputs for the resets. In the styles i started styling the header and the footer. The reason for this logic stands from that I yet could not se the main section. Suddenly I came upon that I have not yet inputed nothing in the main section, so that may be the fundemantal problem. The first problem i stumbled upon before this challenge was that the content did not take full capacity of the avalailable space on the screen. It approximetly took like one-quarter of the screen.
